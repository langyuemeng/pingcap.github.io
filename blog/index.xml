      <description>Earlier this year, Team PingCAP open-sourced TiDB Data Migration (DM), an integrated data transfer and replication management platform that supports full data migration and incremental data replication from MySQL or MariaDB instances, or Amazon Aurora, into a TiDB cluster.
Many TiDB users currently use TiDB DM to connect sharded MySQL, MariaDB, or Amazon Aurora to TiDB, treating TiDB almost as a slave, then run analytical workloads on this TiDB cluster to fulfill real-time reporting needs.</description>

      <description>Generally, a large complex system consists of multiple components. To test this system, it is essential to simulate faults in each component. Further, we should integrate fault simulation into the automated testing system without being intrusive to the testing system. We judge the correctness and stability of the system by automatically activating fault points in automated testing to simulate faults and observing whether the final result meets our expectations.</description>

      <title>TiDB-Binlog Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://pingcap.com/blog/tidb-binlog-tutorial/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://pingcap.com/blog/tidb-binlog-tutorial/</guid>
      <description>This tutorial will start with a very simple TiDB-Binlog deployment with a single node of each component (Placement Driver, TiKV Server, TiDB Server, Pump, and Drainer), set up to push data into a MariaDB Server instance.
This tutorial is targeted toward users who have some familiarity with the TiDB Architecture, who may have already set up a TiDB cluster (though that is not mandatory), and who wants to gain hands-on familiarity with the features and functionality of TiDB-Binlog.</description>

      <title>PingCAP Open-Sources TiDB-Binlog to Reduce Migration Cost</title>
      <link>https://pingcap.com/blog/pingcap-open-sources-tidb-binlog-to-reduce-migration-cost/</link>

      <guid>https://pingcap.com/blog/pingcap-open-sources-tidb-binlog-to-reduce-migration-cost/</guid>
      <description>Today, our team at PingCAP is excited to announce that we are open-sourcing our own binlog implementation, TiDB-Binlog. TiDB-Binlog is a tool we&amp;rsquo;ve been developing in-house (until now) to collect binary log data from TiDB server and provide real-time data backup and replication.
It&amp;rsquo;s similar in functionality to MySQL master-slave replication, but the main difference is that because TiDB is a distributed database, the binlog generated by each TiDB instance needs to be merged and sorted according to the time of the transaction commit before being consumed downstream.</description>

      <title>Titan: A RocksDB Plugin to Reduce Write Amplification</title>
      <link>https://pingcap.com/blog/titan-storage-engine-design-and-implementation/</link>

      <guid>https://pingcap.com/blog/titan-storage-engine-design-and-implementation/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Titan is a RocksDB plugin for key-value separation, inspired by WiscKey, a paper issued in USENIX FAST 2016. It&amp;rsquo;s available for preview in TiDB 3.0. The goal of Titan is to reduce write amplification in RocksDB when using large values.
WiscKey is specifically designed for solid-state drives (SSDs). WiscKey separates keys from values, which generates random I/O that is not well suited for hard drives. Our internal testing indicates that when the value size in Key-Value pairs is large, Titan performs better than RocksDB in write, update, and point read scenarios.</description>

      <description>If you come to TiDB, an open source NewSQL database, from a MySQL background, you are likely comfortable with transaction processing workloads, but analytics may be new to you.
I know in my case, as someone who&amp;rsquo;s spent more than 15 years in the MySQL world, while I can explain how redo log flushing works in InnoDB, only until recently did it become natural for me to write a simple query with a window function.</description>

      <description>TiDB-DM (Data Migration) is an integrated data transfer and replication management platform that supports full data migration or incremental data replication from MySQL or MariaDB instances into a TiDB cluster.
A common real-life use case is using TiDB-DM to connect sharded MySQL or MariaDB to TiDB, treating TiDB almost as a slave, then run analytical workloads on this TiDB cluster to fulfill real-time reporting needs. TiDB-DM provides good support if you need to manage multiple data replication tasks at the same time or need to merge multiple MySQL/MariaDB instances into a single TiDB cluster.</description>

      <description>TiDB-Binlog is a tool used to collect the logical changes made to a TiDB cluster and provide incremental backup and replication.
TiDB-Binlog is similar in functionality to MySQL master-slave replication, which relies on persisting a logical set of changes into a binary log. The main difference is that since TiDB is a distributed database, the binlog generated by each TiDB instance needs to be merged and sorted according to the time of the transaction commit before being consumed downstream.</description>

      <description>As businesses adopt cloud-native architectures, conversations will naturally lead to what we can do to make the database horizontally scalable. The answer will likely be to take a closer look at TiDB.
TiDB is an open source NewSQL database released under the Apache 2.0 License. Because it speaks the MySQL protocol, your existing applications will be able to connect to it using any MySQL connector, and most SQL functionality remains identical (joins, subqueries, transactions, etc.</description>

      <guid>https://pingcap.com/blog/lease-read/</guid>
      <description>TiKV, an open source distributed transactional key-value store (also a Cloud Native Computing Foundation member project), uses the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure strong data consistency and high availability. Raft bears many similarities to other consensus algorithms like Paxos in its ability to ensure fault-tolerance and its performance implementations, but generally easier to understand and implement. While our team has written extensively on how Raft is used in TiKV (some examples: Raft in TiKV, the Design and Implementation of Multi-raft, Raft Optimization), one topic we haven’t discussed is when stale read happens due to a brain split within a Raft group, and the old Raft leader is not aware that a new leader is elected, what should we do?</description>

      <guid>https://pingcap.com/blog/9-whys-to-ask-when-evaluating-a-distributed-database/</guid>
      <description>When I first started building TiDB with my co-founders, we encountered countless challenges, pitfalls, and critical design choices that could have made or broken the project. To build an enterprise-grade distributed database like TiDB from scratch, we have to constantly make difficult decisions that balance the speed of development with long-term considerations for our customers and our team.
Three years and two big releases later, TiDB 2.0 is now deployed in-production in more than 200 companies.</description>

      <description>Consensus is one of the most important challenges in designing and building distributed systems&amp;ndash;how to make sure multiple nodes (or agents, processes, threads, tasks, participants, etc.) in a group agree on a specific value proposed by at least one of the nodes. As an open-source distributed scalable HTAP database, TiDB uses the Raft Consensus Algorithm in its distributed transactional key-value storage engine, TiKV, to ensure data consistency, auto-failover, and fault tolerance.</description>

      <description>TiDB 2.0 is Ready! TiDB is an open-source distributed scalable Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) database. It is designed to provide infinite horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability. TiDB is MySQL compatible and serves as a one-stop data warehouse for both OLTP (Online Transactional Processing) and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) workload.
When we launched TiDB 1.0 last October, we were excited but also a bit nervous. After working on TiDB heads-down, non-stop for more than two years, even with the support of a large (and growing) open-source community, we weren’t sure how the world would receive what we’ve built.</description>

      <description>What is Chaos? In the world of distributed computing, you can never predict what will happen to your cluster. Anything is possible. A butterfly fluttering in Rio de Janeiro could change the weather in Chicago, or destroy an entire data center in Cairo. Network Time Protocol (NTP) might be out of sync, CPUs might mysteriously max out, or worse yet, your diligent DBA might accidentally remove data in the middle of the night.</description>

      <title>How to do Performance Tuning on TiDB, A Distributed NewSQL Database</title>
      <link>https://pingcap.com/blog/performance_tuning_on_a_distributed_newsql_database/</link>

      <guid>https://pingcap.com/blog/performance_tuning_on_a_distributed_newsql_database/</guid>
      <description>Author: Jinpeng Zhang, Database Engineer, Storage Team at PingCAP
Doing performance tuning on distributed systems is no joking matter. It’s much more complicated than on a single node server, and bottlenecks can pop up anywhere, from system resources in a single node or subcomponent, to cooperation between nodes, to even network bandwidth. Performance tuning is a practice that aims to find these bottlenecks and address them, in order to reveal more bottlenecks and address them as well, until the system reaches an optimal performance level.</description>

      <description>Preface At re:Invent 2017, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced Amazon Time Sync Service, a highly accurate and reliable time reference that is natively accessible from Amazon EC2 instances. It is much like the Google TrueTime published in 2012. Why do Google and AWS both want to make efforts to provide global time service? Is there any inspiration for building distributed database? This topic is important to think about.
Time synchronization remains a hard nut to crack in distributed systems, especially for distributed databases such as TiDB where time is used to confirm the order of the transaction to guarantee the ACID compliance.</description>

      <description>Paxos or Raft is frequently used to ensure data consistency in the distributed databases. But Paxos is known for its complexity and is rather difficult to understand while Raft is very simple. Therefore, a lot of emerging databases tend to use Raft as the consensus algorithm at its bottom layer. TiKV is no exception.
Simple as Raft is, its performance is not ideal if we follow exactly the way introduced in the Paper.</description>

      <description>What is Rust Rust is a systems programming language sponsored by Mozilla Research. It moves fast and steady with a 6-week release cycle ever since its 1.0 version in May 2015.
See the following list for some of the features that most attract us:
 The design principles of Rust resemble with C++ in Abstraction without overhead and RAII (Resource acquisition is initialization).
 The minimum runtime and efficient C bindings empower Rust to be as efficient as C and C++, thus making it very suitable for the systems programming field where high performance matters the most.</description>

Table of Content  Foreword Storing data Key-Value RocksDB Raft Region MVCC Transaction Miscellaneous  Foreword: Database, operating system and compiler are known as the three big systems and regarded as the footstone of the whole computer software. Among them, database supports the businesses and is closer to the application layer. After decades of development, progress keeps emerging in this field.
Many people must have used databases of different kinds, but few have the experience of developing one, especially a distributed database.</description>

      <description>This document describes how to add built-in functions to TiDB.
 Background The procedure to add a built-in function Example  Background How is the SQL statement executed in TiDB?
The SQL statement is parsed to an abstract syntax tree (AST) by the parser first and then uses Query Optimizer to generate an execution plan. The plan can then be executed to get the result. This process involves how to access the data in the table, and how to filter, calculate, sort, aggregate, and distinct the data, etc.</description>

A common subquery is embedded within the FROM clause, for example：
SELECT ID FROM (SELECT * FROM SRC) AS T The subexpressions in the FROM clauses can be processed very well by the general SQL optimizers.</description>

      <description>Introduction to concurrency control Serializability is the classical concurrency scheme. It ensures that a schedule for executing concurrent transactions is equivalent to one that executes the transactions serially in some order. Though serializablity is a great concept, it is hard to implement efficiently. A classical solution is a variant of Two-Phase Locking, aka 2PL. Using 2PL, the database management system (DBMS) maintains read and write locks to ensure that conflicting transactions are executed in a well-defined order, or in serializable execution schedules.</description>

      <description>About the History Read feature in TiDB Data is the core and is a matter of life and death for every business. So ensuring the data safety is the top priority of every database. From a macro point of view, the safety of data is not only about whether a database is stable enough that no data is lost, but also about whether a sufficient and convenient solution is in place when data is lost because of the business or human errors, for example, to solve the anti-cheat problem in the game industry or to meet the audit requirements in the financing business.</description>
