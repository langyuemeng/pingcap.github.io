Licensee may not assign or transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, any of its rights under this Agreement (including without limitation its licenses with respect to the Licensed Software) to any third party without PingCAP’s prior written consent.

You agree to comply with all U.S. and foreign export control laws and regulations, including but not limited to the U.S. Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, and successor legislation, and the Export Administration Regulations passed by the Department of Commerce.  You expressly agree that You shall not export, directly or indirectly, re-export, divert, or transfer the Licensed Software or any direct product thereof to any destination, company or person restricted or prohibited by U.S. export controls.
